COURSE DECRIPTION
=============================================================================================================
This is the MATLAB Grader part to develop some basic functionality of a Stroop Test demo. 

<<INSERT PICTURE HERE>>

I developed this demo to show some basic functionality of MATLAB to be used for teaching purposes, namely:
* The use of MATLAB Apps to generate data and allow for user interaction
* The use of MATLAB Live Scripts for evaluation
* The access of Excel data
* Finally, the use of MATLAB Grader to help develop simple code snippets for all these parts



PROBLEM DESCRIPTIONS
===========================================================================================================
# Assignment: "Evaluating the results"
## Problem: Reading a .csv file
Below I provided you with some basic data of a participant in .csv file format. The file is called ParticipantXYZ.csv. Your task will be to read this file, using the readtable function. Refere to the MATLAB documentation <<INSERT LINK>> to learn more about this funtion. Your task is to
read the whole file and save the data in a MATLAB table called results
derive the number of trials from the table and assign it to a variable numTrials
